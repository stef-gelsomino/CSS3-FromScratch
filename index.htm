				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets">CSS3</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.

				<h2>About Selectors</h2>
			</section>

			<section class="aside-body">
				In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.

				Selectors may apply to:

				all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2
				elements specified by attribute, in particular:
				id: an identifier unique within the document
				class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document
				elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.
				Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters and underscores. A class may apply to any number of instances of any elements. An ID may only be applied to a single element.

				Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as ::first-line or ::first-letter.

				Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility.[6] Multiple selectors may be joined in a spaced list to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div .myClass {color: red;} applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color: red;} applies to all div elements that are in elements of class myClass.
